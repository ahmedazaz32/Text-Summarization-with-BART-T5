# Text-summarisation-with-BART-T5
<h5>BART and T5 are state-of-the-art machine learning models developed by Lewis et al. 2019 (Facebook Research) and Raffel et al. 2019 (Google Research). They have been trained to summarize text and are made available for easy use by @HuggingFace's Transformers library. This notebook shows how to summarise history's most influential books like the Communist Manifesto or Orwell's 1984 in a few lines of code in a few minutes with these two models.</h5>
